        <div style="height: 150px; overflow-y: scroll;">
          On this screen:<br /><br />
          1. type in 1 or 2 words to search for a food<br />
          2. pick from the search results which food you are eating/going to eat<br />
          3. type how many servings you will eat (.5, 1, 2, ...)<br />
          <br/><br/>
          After step 2 you will see serving size, and a serving's gram weight of what you have chosen.
          <br/><br/>
          After step 3 you will see how many grams you have/will eat, given what you have entered.
          <br/><br/>
          After step 3 you can also see the nutritional breakdown below that, before you press the save/eat button.
          <br/><br/>
          The save/eat button looks like a knife and a spoon crossed with each other.  This will save what you have entered as 
          something you have eaten for the day, and then clear the screen to be ready to allow you to enter/eat the next thing.
          <br/><br/>
          <div style="font-weight: bold;">"Only Search Generic Food List"</div>
          With this switched on (this is the default), you will only search a set of generic foods.  To increase your
          search to include brand name items, you will need to switch this off.   
          <br />
          <br />
          
          <div>
              After you have...
              <br />
              <br /> 1. searched for food
              <br /> 2. picked a food
              <br /> 3. and specified how many servings you want...
              <br />
              <br/>
              <br/> ...then you will see the nutrients you care about under...
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <div style="font-weight: bold;">"Nutrients you care about..."</div>
              This will show you how much of each nutrient you care about occurs in the food you have chosen to "eat".
              <br />
              <br /> Note: if you just want to see this and not record it you don't have to ever press the "eat" button
              to save what you have entered.
          </div>
          <br />
          <br />
          
          <div>
              It is possible, before you save with the eat button, that you will actually want to save this particular food entry for a
              different day or time, in order to keep track of what day you actually ate something. This field
              allows you to do this; just change the date by pressing the "change date" button, and then save
              your food as normal.
              <br />
              <br/> The food you have saved will save as if you had eaten it on that date!
              <br/>
          </div>
