        <div style="height: 100px; overflow-y: scroll;">
          On this screen:<br />
          1. type in 1 or 2 words to search for a food<br />
          2. pick from the search results which food you are eating/going to eat<br />
          3. type how many servings you will eat (.5, 1, 2, ...)<br />
          <br/><br/>
          After step 2 you will see serving size, and a serving's gram weight of what you have chosen.
          <br/><br/>
          After step 3 you will see how many grams you have/will eat, given what you have entered.
          <br/><br/>
          After step 3 you can also see the nutritional breakdown below that, before you press the save/eat button.
          <br/><br/>
          The save/eat button looks like a knife and a spoon crossed with each other.  This will save what you have entered as 
          something you have eaten for the day, and then clear the screen to be ready to allow you to enter/eat the next thing.
          <br/><br/>
          <div style="font-weight: bold;">"Only Search Generic Food List"</div>
          With this switched on, you will only search a set of generic foods.  To increase your
          search to include brand name items, you will need to switch this off.
